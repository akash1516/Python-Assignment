    "Q1. What is Exception in pthon? Write the difference  between Exceptions and syntax errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It is an indication that something unexpected or erroneous has happened while the program is running. When an Exception occurs, the program stops running and an error message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter is unable to parse the code due to a mistake in the syntax. A syntax error is typically detected before the program is run, and it prevents the program from being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the code itself, while Exceptions are caused by external factors such as input data or system issues. Exceptions can also occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is run."
